This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the example analysis found in "Investigating Ecological Interactions in the Tumor Microenvironment using Joint Species Distribution Models for Point Patterns" by Joel Eliason and Arvind Rao. The vignette contains most of the analysis, while utils.R contains several helper functions, and hpc.R contains code to run the model detailed in the paper in parallel on a cluster.
