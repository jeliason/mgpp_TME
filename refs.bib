  abstract = {In an effort to effectively model observed patterns in the spatial configuration of individuals of multiple species in nature, we introduce the saturated pairwise interaction Gibbs point process. Its main strength lies in its ability to model both attraction and repulsion within and between species, over different scales. As such, it is particularly well-suited to the study of associations in complex ecosystems. Based on the existing literature, we provide an easy to implement fitting procedure as well as a technique to make inference for the model parameters. We also prove that under certain hypotheses the point process is locally stable, which allows us to use the well-known `coupling from the past' algorithm to draw samples from the model. Different numerical experiments show the robustness of the model. We study three different ecological data sets, demonstrating in each one that our model helps disentangle competing ecological effects on species' distribution.},

  abstract = {The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that involves interactions between different cell types, such as cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells. These interactions can promote or inhibit tumor growth and affect response to therapy. Multitype Gibbs point process (MGPP) models are statistical models used to study the spatial distribution and interaction of different types of objects, such as the distribution of cell types in a tissue sample. Such models are potentially useful for investigating the spatial relationships between different cell types in the tumor microenvironment, but so far studies of the TME using cell-resolution imaging have been largely limited to spatial descriptive statistics. However, MGPP models have many advantages over descriptive statistics, such as uncertainty quantification, incorporation of multiple covariates and the ability to make predictions. In this paper, we describe and apply a previously developed MGPP method, the saturated pairwise interaction Gibbs point process model, to a publicly available multiplexed imaging dataset obtained from colorectal cancer patients. Importantly, we show how these methods can be used as joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to precisely frame and answer many relevant questions related to the ecology of the tumor microenvironment.},
